If you downloaded binaries, the only slightly exotic library that needs to be
present on your system is libpython3.6m.so.1.0.

This file gives some instructions on how to compile khoca from source. You are
welcome to email me at <lukas@lewark.de> for help.
You will need:
* a version of gcc that supports c++11.
* cython.
* mpir, compiled with c++ support.
* gp/pari.
* python3

If your python version is not 3.6, change the variable PYTHONVERSION in the
make file accordingly.  If you installed the above-mentioned libraries to a
non-standard location, you might need to add an -I parameter to GENERALCFLAGS,
or an -L parameter to STATIC_DIRECTIVE. Then, run make. This should produce the
file bin/pui.so. Compilation may take quite a while. If you encounter problems,
you may wish to uncomment the two lines after "Fast compile" in the Makefile,
and comment out the two lines after "Not Debugging". Also, you can delete lines
81 - 93 in src/shared.h. These measures will lead to faster compilation.

Now you are set! Run

./khoca.py 0 0.0 0 braidaaa calc0

to test. The output should be:

Frobenius algebra: Z[X] / (1*X^2).
Result:
Reduced Homology:
Non-equivariant homology:
t^-3q^8 + t^-2q^6 + t^0q^2
Unreduced Homology:
Non-equivariant homology:
t^-3q^9 + t^-2q^5 + t^0q^1 + t^0q^3 + t^-2q^7[2]
